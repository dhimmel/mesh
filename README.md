# Uses-friendly extensions to MeSH

The [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) (MeSH) is a controled vocabulary produced by the NLM for cataloging biomedical information. The resource is structured as an ontology and is used for PubMed/MEDLINE annotation. Here we provide user-friendly datasets derived from MeSH. Currently, two [record types](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_record_types.html "MeSH Record Types") are processed: Descriptors and Supplementary Concept Records.


## Notebooks

+ [`descriptors.ipynb`](descriptors.ipynb) — processes Descriptors (also known as Main Headings)
+ [`supplementary-concept-records.ipynb`](supplementary-concept-records.ipynb) — processes Supplementary Concept Records (SCRs)
